# Business Analysis

The definition from the IIBA BABOK v3:

The practice of
enabling **change** in the **context** of an enterprise
by defining **needs** and recommending **solutions**
that deliver **value** to **stakeholders**.

The highlighted words are the six core concepts in the BACCM (Business Analysis Core Concept Model).
Knowing this would be more useful to me if I hadn't finally decided that the BCS route was more appropriate to my needs.
